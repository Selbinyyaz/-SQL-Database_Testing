# -SQL-Database_Testing
Using JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity API) which is a Java based library that allows interaction with different DataBases.
I establish a Connection to our database using DriveManager Class and passing parameters such as DatabaseURL, username and password. My Database URL consists of “jdbc: type of jdbc: host: port: database name”.
Once connection is established I will prepare Statement Object that will allow to send SQL queries to the Database And then results from the Database will be stored inside ResultSet Object.
